	abstract = {An integration scheme is presented for modeling the texture evolution and stress-strain response of elasto-viscoplastic polycrystalline materials. Single crystal kinematics based on a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient is used to obtain an evolution equation for the crystal elastic deformation gradient. An implicit scheme to integrate this equation is presented which is stable and efficient. The reorientation of the crystal as well as the elastic strain can then be obtained from a polar decomposition of the elastic deformation gradient. Numerical studies are presented using material parameters for aluminum {(FCC} crystals) and zircaloy {(HCP} crystals) to demonstrate the general nature of the model. Predictions of the model are also compared with those obtained using a rigid-viscoplastic polycrystal model which neglects the elastic response. Retaining the elastic response makes the model useful for large deformation analyses where both anisotropy due to texture as well as elastic effects such as springback and residual stresses are important.},

the operative deformation modes under various states of stress. Only limited texture strengthening is observed for conditions

differential occurs along thec axis direction, but this cannot be attributed to twinning. It is shown that {\textless}c +a{\textgreater} slip can play a major role in plastic deformation, and that the observed mechanical properties result from the peculiar

	abstract = {Elastically anisotropic, physically based, length-scale- and rate-dependent crystal plasticity finite element investigations of a model hcp polycrystal are presented and a systematic study was carried out on the effects of combinations of crystallographic orientations on local, grain-level stresses and accumulated slip in cycles containing cold dwell. It is shown that the most damaging combination is the one comprising a primary hard grain with -axis near-parallel to the loading direction and an adjacent soft grain having -axis near-normal to the load and a prismatic slip plane at approximately 70{\textdegree} to the normal to the load. We term such a combination a combination. In passing, we compare results with the Stroh model and show that even under conditions of plasticity in the hcp polycrystal, the Stroh model qualitatively predicts some of the observed behaviours. It is shown that under very particular circumstances, a {\textendash} occurs which leads to particularly localized accumulated slip in the soft grain and the penetration of the slip into the adjacent hard grain. The interaction effect occurs only when the (morphological) orientation of the grain boundary in the rogue grain combination coincides (within approximately {\textpm}5{\textdegree}) with the (crystallographic) orientation of an active slip system in the soft grain. It is argued that the rogue grain combination and the morphological{\textendash}crystallographic interaction are responsible for fatigue facet formation in Ti alloys with cold dwell, and a possible mechanism for facet formation is presented. The experimental observations of fatigue facet formation have been reviewed and they provide considerable support for the conclusions from the crystal plasticity modelling. In particular, faceting was found to occur at precisely those locations predicted by the model, i.e. at a rogue grain combination. Some experimental evidence for the need for a crystallographic{\textendash}morphological interaction in faceting is also presented.},

This was accomplished by treating the dominant twin systems in a given crystal as independent grains once the total twin volume fraction in that crystal reached a predetermined saturation value. The newly formed grains were allowed to independently undergo further slip and the concomitant lattice rotation, but further twinning was prohibited. New descriptions have been established for slip and twin hardening and the complex coupling between them.

	abstract = {In this study, effects of typical texture components observed in rolled aluminum alloy sheets on shear band formation in plane strain tension/compression and bending are systematically studied. The material response is described by a generalized Taylor-type polycrystal model, in which each grain is characterized in terms of an elastic-viscoplastic continuum slip constitutive relation. First, a simple model analysis in which the shear band is assumed to occur in a weaker thin slice of material is performed. From this simple model analysis, two important quantities regarding shear band formation are obtained: i.e. the critical strain at the onset of shear banding and the corresponding orientation of shear band. Second, the shear band development in plane strain tension/compression is analyzed by the finite element method. Predictability of the finite element analysis is compared to that of the simple model analysis. Third, shear band developments in plane strain pure bending of a sheet specimen with the typical textures are studied. Regions near the surfaces in a bent sheet specimen are approximately subjected to plane strain tension or compression. From this viewpoint, the bendability of a sheet specimen may be evaluated, using the knowledge regarding shear band formation in plane strain tension/compression. To confirm this and to encompass overall deformation of a bent sheet specimen, including shear bands, finite element analyses of plane strain pure bending are carried out, and the predicted shear band formation in bent specimens is compared to that in the tension/compression problem. Finally, the present results are compared to previous related studies, and the efficiency of the present method for materials design in future is discussed.},

the ? colony size of the {BM,} several hundred microns, to that of fine equiaxed primary ? grains that are on the order of 1 ?m. This change in the microstructure resulting from {FSP} is expected to increase fatigue crack initiation resistance making
it beneficial for titanium components for aerospace applications. The as-cast coarse lamellar microstructure has superior
fatigue crack growth resistance compared to other microstructures that can be obtained by thermomechanical processing. Thus,
it is likely that an increase in fatigue life is obtainable by {FSP.} Given the growing interest in friction stir welding {(FSW)}

we propose terminology to standardize the descriptions of the microstructures created during {FSP} and {FSW} of titanium alloys.

	abstract = {The recent advances in the development of constitutive equations for large deformations of ductile single crystals and the development of robust finite element procedures for solving non-homogeneous boundary-value problems using these constitutive models, provide a foundation for understanding and predicting many features of the localization of deformation into shear bands. This paper presents the results of a numerical simulation of the effects of crystallographic texture evolution on the process of shear band formation in plane strain compression of initially isotropic {OFHC} polycrystalline copper. An aggregate of single crystals is used to represent a polycrystal. The calculations are two-dimensional plane strain at the macroscopic level, but they use the actual slip system structure for fee materials with twelve {111} 110 type slip systems. In the calculations an element of the finite element mesh represents either a single crystal or a part of a single crystal, and the constitutive response at an integration point is given by the single crystal constitutive model. The calculation procedures enforce equilibrium and compatibility throughout the polycrystalline aggregate in the weak finite element sense. No initial material or geometric imperfections are prescribed, but the initial lattice orientations are different from one grain to the next. The localization of deformation in the simulations is found to be a natural outcome of large deformation processes in ductile polycrystalline materials, and associated with the concurrent evolution of crystallographic texture.
Comparison of results from the numerical simulations against experimental measurements shows that the resolution of grain-scale micro-shear bands requires very fine finite element meshes. The limitations of our computers are such that at present even very refined finite element meshes are too coarse to capture grain-scale shear bands. However, our simulations do capture the major features that are observed experimentally. In particular, the averaged global stress-strain behavior, the crystallographic texture, and the orientation of macroscale shear bands predicted by our simulations are close to those measured in our experiments.},

Even though the description of crystal plasticity within the context of modern continuum mechanics goes back to the early 1960s, there is no universally accepted solution as to how to identify a unique set of active slip systems. Furthermore, some recently proposed integration schemes have neither been compared with other methods nor tested under complex multiaxial stress conditions thus rendering a direct assessment difficult. In this work, the predictive capabilities of existing crystal plasticity and visco-plasticity formulations and algorithms when subjected to complex multiaxial loading paths are investigated, and their relative accuracies established. In order to compare consistently the performance of different models, a generic thermodynamics-based crystallographic framework, which incorporates current formulations as special cases, is proposed. Several two-dimensional boundary value problems for elasto-plastic and elasto-viscoplastic {FCC} crystals are selected as benchmark cases. The effects of multiaxial loading paths, latent hardening, and dissipated energy on the selection of active slip systems at sharp yield surface corners are investigated. The differences in the predicted behaviour were found to be associated with both the particular form of the single crystal formulations and the algorithms used in their numerical implementations.

	abstract = {Modelling of microstructure evolution has long been part of physical metallurgy, both in the laboratory and in industry. Until recently, however, physically-based modelling was limited to idealised alloys under controlled laboratory conditions, while the complexity of industrial processing of commercial alloys necessitated empirical approaches. The advent of powerful computing facilities, and in particular the rapid growth in application of the finite element method to metals processing, has stimulated new research with the aim of bringing the two areas together. The present review describes progress in this rapidly expanding field. The preliminary review in Section 1 illustrates the potential of integrating microstructural modelling with the very detailed process histories which are available from modern finite element analyses. The [`]internal state variable' approach is identified as a particularly appropriate method to reach the objective of providing useful predictive capability in industrial processing, within the scope of personal computers. The general method, and its simplification for single parameter models in which the microstructure evolution may be treated as an [`]isokinetic' reaction, are outlined in Section 2. The paper then presents internal state variable formulations for a range of thermal problems, as temperature-controlled processes dominate. These are solid-state diffusional transformations (precipitate dissolution, nucleation and growth, and coarsening) in Section 3; solidification and subsequent solid-state phase transformations in Section 4; and grain growth in Section 5. Case studies are presented for each problem, illustrating the applicability of the approach to industrially relevant processing of commercial alloys. Examples range from casting, to cooling after hot forming, to heat treatment and welding. Bringing together this range of phenomena and processes in one review makes two specific points: (a) the state variable formulation offers a robust modelling framework, in which real non-isothermal process histories may be readily linked to fundamental isothermal theories of microstructure evolution, (b) depending on the problem, different levels of approximation can be accepted without invalidating the results, but the modeller needs to exercise critical judgement to find the optimum level of complexity. Finally in Section 6, a number of examples are presented in which state variable models have been fully integrated with finite element analyses, with two examples from welding and one from casting. These case studies demonstrate that significant opportunities now exist for enhancing industrial processing capabilities. At the same time, the underlying microstructural modelling provides a renewed stimulus for improving scientific understanding of some of the classical problems of physical metallurgy.},

Therefore, a more physically realistic constitutive model should be used to take into account the discrete grains and their crystallographic orientation distribution in this region to better capture the heterogeneity of the dislocation slip in the fretting damage process volume. This is accomplished by using a continuum crystal plasticity material model developed to represent these effects in {Ti-6Al-4V.} A two-dimensional finite element analysis is used to simulate an ideal fretting condition. This study examines how the characteristics of the plasticity produced by fretting changes with key fretting parameters including the normal contact force, the tangential force amplitude, and the coefficient of friction at the contact. The results produced using a continuum crystal plasticity model show that the distribution of plastic strain is highly heterogeneous and it contains both cyclic and ratchetting components.},

Three well-known lattice orientation relationships between the b.c.c. and h.c.p. phases, each of which was also slightly perturbed in various ways, were utilized. All of the planar interfaces thus formed which were based upon parallel pairs of low index planes can be described by two arrays of parallel misfit dislocations. The possibility of replacing one array of misfit dislocations with an array of structural ledges was then analyzed. In the presence of {near-Burgers} orientation relationships, the most probable structural ledges were found to have terraces with risers 2, 4 or 6 atomic layers high. This type of structural ledge has a Burgers vector of 1/12[111]b.c.c., which lies in the terrace plane, associated with its riser. Thus it can replace a set of a-type misfit dislocations; hence only a single set of c-type misfit dislocations is now necessary on the terrace of structural ledges. This types of structural ledge was also found to step down along the lattice invariant line in order to accommodate simultaneously the misfit normal to the terrace plane. Further, the possibility of structural ledges with (1101)h.c.p.//(110)b.c.c. terrace was also discerned in the presence of {near-Potter} orientation relationships.},

of commercially important titanium alloys, such as {Ti-6Al-4V,} is a valuable step toward the accelerated maturation of materials.
This paper will discuss the development of neural network models based on a Bayesian framework to predict the yield and ultimate
tensile strengths of {Ti-6Al-4V} at room temperature. The development of such rules-based model requires the population of extensive
databases, which in the present case are microstructurally based. The steps involved in database development include producing
controlled variations of the microstructure using novel approaches to heat treatments, the use of standardized stereology
protocols to characterize and quantify microstructural features rapidly, and mechanical testing of the heat-treated specimens.
These databases have been used to train and test neural network models for prediction of tensile properties. In addition,
these models have been used to identify the influence of individual microstructural features on the tensile properties, consequently
guiding the efforts toward development of more robust mechanistically based models. Based on the neural network model, it
is possible to investigate the influence of individual microstructural features on the tensile properties, and in certain
cases these dependencies can point toward unrecognized phenomena. For example, the apparently unexpected trend of increase
in tensile strength with increasing prior ?-grain size has led to the determination of the pronounced role of the basketweave microstructure in strengthening these alloys,
especially in case of larger prior ? grains.},

Constant strain rate and creep tests were performed on single-colony crystals of a near-[alpha] alloy oriented for slip along different prismatic slip systems in the [alpha] phase. A distinct anisotropy in the deformation behavior of different colony crystals is found. The origin of this anisotropy is due to the relative misalignment of the slip systems between the [alpha] and the [beta] phases which results in the formation of residual dislocations during slip transmission.

analysis of spatially resolved electron backscatter diffraction {(EBSD)} patterns. Generalized {Hashin-Shtrikman} {(GHS)} bounds
incorporating two-point statistical data were found to be 75 pct narrower than the {Voigt-Reuss} bounds. A perturbation expansion
technique yielded two sets of bounds of comparable quality. An experimental acoustic measurement of the bulk elastic response
of the plate was found to lie between the calculated bounds. In addition, a perturbation estimate was obtained which exceeds
the measured response, but still falls within all of the calculated bounds. The influence of crystallographic texture was
investigated for a variety of simulated textured copper polycrystals and was found to cause significant differences in the
macroscopic elastic properties.},

Heating rates of 0.42, 5, 10, and 50 K s-1 were utilized. After reaching the peak temperature, a special cooling procedure was utilized to avoid complete decomposition of the beta phase during cool-down and thus enable direct determination of its texture at the end of high-temperature annealing. It was found that beta grain growth is strongly affected by texture whose evolution can give rise to a behavior which is discontinuous in nature. As a result, dramatic differences in grain-growth behavior were noted in the two lots of material and were explained in terms of variations in beta texture evolution during heat treatment.},

As part of our multicomponent materials design framework, this paper reports the materials simulation segment in developing materials design knowledgebase, which involves four major computational steps: (1) Atomic-scale first-principles calculations to predict thermodynamic properties, lattice parameters, and kinetic data of unary, binary and ternary compounds and solutions phases; (2) {CALPHAD} data optimization approach to compute thermodynamic properties, lattice parameters, and kinetic data of multicomponent systems; (3) Multicomponent phase-field approach to predict the evolution of microstructures in one to three dimensions {(1{\textendash}3D);} and (4) Finite element analysis to generate the mechanical response from the simulated microstructure. These four stages are to be integrated with advanced discretization and parallel algorithms and a software architecture for distributed computing systems.},

Observed qualitative transitions in texture with strain, such as a transient orthotropic symmetry in torsion textures, can help identify the rate at which the {FC-to-RC} transition takes place. The second problem is that of the material dependence of deformation textures among the {FCC} metals which, it is argued, can only be due to a change in deformation modes, i.e., in the shape of the single-crystal yield surface. A heuristic assumption of an increasing importance of (111){\textless}211{\textgreater}-slip as the stacking-fault energy decreases explains the qualitative trend.

Regarding plastic flow, interstitial solutes mainly influence the thermal component of the flow stress, the rate controlling mechanism being the thermally activated overcoming of interstitial solute obstacles by dislocations gliding on the first order prism planes. Strain hardening is given by the commonly observed linear relationship between the flow stress [sigma] and the square root of the dislocation density [rho], where [sigma]f, the stress due to all obstacles other than dislocations, increases with increase in strain rate [epsilon] and interstitial content Ci and with decrease in temperature T. The constant [alpha] is of the order of 0.7 and E is Young's modulus. Both [sigma]f and [alpha] are relatively independent of grain size, d, supporting the work hardening model for the effect of grain size on the flow stress.
The fracture stress increases with decrease in grain size and with increase in interstitial content. As a general trend, the total elongation tends to increase as the temperature is lowered to about 77 K, below which a decrease elongation occurs. The improvement in ductility with decreasing temperature to 77 K is attributed to the occurrence of twinning. Therefore, the effects of grain size, temperature, and interstitial content on ductility at low temperatures reflects in part the influence these variables have on twinning.},

At this temperature, the hot ductility exhibited a sharp peak indicating that the superplasticity process is very sensitive to temperature. The [alpha] grain size increased exponentially with increase in temperature in this domain and the variation is similar to the increase in the [beta] volume fraction in this alloy. At the temperature of peak ductility, the volume fraction of [beta] is about 20\%, suggesting that sliding of [alpha]-[alpha] interfaces is primarily responsible for superplasticity while the [beta] phase present at the grain boundary triple junctions restricts grain growth. The apparent activation energy estimated in the [alpha]-[beta] superplasticity domain is about 330 {kJ} mol-1, which is much higher than that for self diffusion in [alpha]-titanium. (ii) In the [beta] phase field, the alloy exhibits dynamic recrystallization and the variation of grain size with temperature and strain rate could be correlated with the {Zener-Hollomon} parameter. The apparent activation energy in this domain is estimated to be 210 {kJ} mol-1, which is close to that for self diffusion in [beta]. At temperatures around the transus, a ductility peak with unusually high ductility has been observed, which has been attributed to the occurrence of transient superplasticity of [beta] in view of its fine grain size. The material exhibited flow instabilities at strain rates higher than about 1 s-1 and these are manifested as adiabatic shear bands in the [alpha]-[beta] regime.},

New [`]designer' alloys and composites are currently under evaluation as potential replacement materials for selected fan and compressor applications. However, it is recognised that in the current economic climate, where cost is a major factor to be considered at the design stage, conventional alloy systems will remain an essential constituent for the foreseeable future. This implies that titanium alloys will have to be employed more efficiently if they are to continue to meet future requirements. With the implementation of [`]total life' management procedures this highlights the need for a better understanding of deformation and crack development at the grain to grain level since this stage dominates overall life.

	abstract = {This paper develops an accurate and computationally efficient homogenization based continuum plasticity-damage {(HCPD)} model for macroscopic analysis of ductile failure in porous ductile materials containing brittle inclusions. Example of these materials are cast alloys such as aluminum and metal matrix composites. The overall framework of the {HCPD} model follows the structure of the anisotropic {Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman} {(GTN)} type elastoplasticity model for porous ductile materials. The {HCPD} model is assumed to be orthotropic in an evolving material principal coordinate system
throughout the deformation history. The {GTN} model parameters are calibrated from homogenization of evolving variables in representative volume elements {(RVE)} of the microstructure containing inclusions and voids. Micromechanical analyses for this purpose are conducted by the locally enriched Voronoi cell {FEM} {(LE-VCFEM)} [1]. The model also introduces a novel
void nucleation criterion from micromechanical damage evolution due to combined inclusion and matrix cracking. The paper discusses methods for
estimating {RVE} length scales in microstructures with non-uniform dispersions, as well as macroscopic characteristic length scales for non-local constitutive
models. The {HCPD} model has a huge efficiency advantage over micromechanics models. Hence, it is a very effective tool in predicting macroscopic damage in structures with direct reference to microstructural
composition.},

The crystal is modelled by a rate independent, elastic-plastic relation based on Schmid's law which precisely accounts for lattice rotations. Both self hardening and latent hardening of the slip systems are included in the model. The crystal geometry is idealized in terms of a planar double slip model. Initial imperfections are specified in the form of slight thickness inhomogeneities and the calculations follow the crystal deformation through diffuse necking and the formation of shear bands. The pattern of shear bands depends on the initial imperfection, but, independent of the particular small imperfection, the material planes of the bands are inclined at a characteristic angle to the slip planes. Also, the lattice misorientation across the shear band, which is such as to cause geometrical softening of the bands, is not sensitive to the imperfection form. For high strength, low hardening crystals a comparison with existing experimental data shows remarkably good qualitative and quantitative agreement between the calculations and observations. We also model a relatively soft high hardening crystal which undergoes more diffuse necking than the strong high hardening crystal. Diffuse necking leads to lattice rotations which produce geometrical softening and hence promote shear band formation. Furthermore, we carry out a calculation for a high strength low hardening crystal with the latent hardening rate prescribed somewhat larger than for isotropic hardening. In this case a [`]patchy' pattern of slip emerges. However, the course of shear band development is unaffected.},

	abstract = {A new rate dependent constitutive model is developed for polycrystals subjected to arbitrarily large strains. The model is used to predict deformation textures and large-strain strain hardening behavior following various stress-strain histories for single phase f.c.c. aggregates that deform by crystallographic slip. Examples involving uniaxial and plane strain tension and compression are presented which illustrate how texture influences polycrystalline strain hardening, in particular these examples demonstrate both textural strengthening and softening effects. Input to the model includes the description of single crystal strain hardening and latent hardening along with strain rate sensitivity, all properties described on the individual slip system level. The constitutive formulation used for the individual grains is essentially that developed by Peirce et al. [6, Acta metall. 31, 1951 (1983)] to solve rate dependent boundary value problems for finitely deformed single crystals. Inclusion of rate dependence is shown to overcome the long standing problem of nonuniqueness in the choice of active slip systems which is inherent in the rate independent theory. Because the slipping rates on all slip systems within each grain are unique in the rate dependent theory, the lattice rotations and thus the textures that develop are unique. In addition, the model makes it possible to study how strain rate sensitivity on the slip system, and single grain, levels is manifested in polycrystalline strain rate sensitivity. The model is also used to predict "constant offset plastic strain yield surfaces" for materials that are nearly rate insensitive--these calculations describe the development of rounded "yield surface vertices" and the resulting softening of material stiffness to a change in loading path that vertices imply. For our rate dependent solid this reduction in stiffness occurs after small but finite loading increments. Finally the model is used to carry out an imperfection-based sheet necking analysis both for isotropic and strongly textured sheets. The results show that larger strain hardening rates, and strain rate sensitivity, on the slip system level both increase the failure strains, as expected, but also demonstrate a strong influence of texture on localized necking.},

In addition to allowing the effects of material rate sensitivity to be explored, the present rate dependent formulation permits the analysis of a range of material strain hardening properties and crystal geometries that could not be analyzed within a rate independent framework. Two crystal geometries are modeled. One is a planar model of an f.c.c. crystal undergoing symmetric primary-conjugate slip. For this geometry, a direct comparison with a previous rate independent calculation shows that material rate sensitivity delays shear band development significantly. Our present rate dependent formulation also enables a more complete exploration of the effects of high (i.e. greater than Taylor) latent hardening ratios on "patchy" slip development. In particular we show that strong latent hardening and patchy slip can give rise to kinematical constraints that prevent shear bands from propagating completely across the gage section. The second geometry models a b.c.c. crystal oriented so that there is approximately a double mode of slip with the slip systems inclined by more than 45{\textdegree} to the tensile axis. This calculation displays the formation of a localized band of conjugate slip. The lattice rotations accompanying this mode eventually lead to a decrease in the resolved shear stress on the more active system in the band so that the bands do not accumulate large strains and catastrophic shear bands do not form. The implications of material rate sensitivity for uniqueness are also discussed with reference to implications for the prediction of mechanical properties of polycrystals.},

(in preparation) using a power law representation for the plastic slip rates. The existing implicit form of the model provides qualitative matching with experiments at quasi-static strain rates. The model is recast in an explicit form and applied first to a high quasi-static strain rate to verify that the two forms of the model return similar predictions for similar input parameters. The explicit model is also applied to several high strain rates, showing that it captures characteristic features observed in experimental tests of high-rate deformations, such as the drop in stress immediately after yield that is present in split Hopkinson pressure bar {(SHPB)} experiments. This test provides qualitative evidence that the model is suitable for high-strain-rate applications. The utility of the model is further demonstrated by a one-dimensional simulation of a {SHPB} test. Finally, a test case modeling pressure impact of a Tantalum plate using 600,000 elements is shown. The simulations show that the explicit model is capable of recovering the salient features of the experiments while integrating the constitutive update in a robust manner.},

	abstract = {Single crystal constitutive equations based on dislocation density {(SCCE-D)} were developed from Orowan's strengthening equation and simple geometric relationships of the operating slip systems. The flow resistance on a slip plane was computed using the Burger's vector, line direction, and density of the dislocations on all other slip planes, with no adjustable parameters. That is, the latent/self-hardening matrix was determined by the crystallography of the slip systems alone. The multiplication of dislocations on each slip system incorporated standard 3-parameter dislocation density evolution equations applied to each slip system independently; this is the only phenomenological aspect of the {SCCE-D} model. In contrast, the most widely used single crystal constitutive equations for texture analysis {(SCCE-T)} feature 4 or more adjustable parameters that are usually back-fit from a polycrystal flow curve. In order to compare the accuracy of the two approaches to reproduce single crystal behavior, tensile tests of single crystals oriented for single slip were simulated using crystal plasticity finite element modeling. Best-fit parameters (3 for {SCCE-D,} 4 for {SCCE-T)} were determined using either multiple or single slip stress-strain curves for copper and iron from the literature. Both approaches reproduced the data used for fitting accurately. Tensile tests of copper and iron single crystals oriented to favor the remaining combinations of slip systems were then simulated using each model (i.e. multiple slip cases for equations fit to single slip, and vice versa). In spite of fewer fit parameters, the {SCCE-D} predicted the flow stresses with a standard deviation of 14 {MPa,} less than one half that for the {SCCE-T} conventional equations: 31 {MPa.} Polycrystalline texture simulations were conducted to compare predictions of the two models. The predicted polycrystal flow curves differed considerably, but the differences in texture evolution were insensitive to the type of constitutive equations. The {SCCE-D} method provides an improved representation of single-crystal plastic response with fewer adjustable parameters, better accuracy, and better predictivity than the constitutive equations most widely used for texture analysis {(SCCE-T).}},

In this paper, firstly the dislocation density rate and the grain growth rate varying with the processing parameters (deformation temperature, strain rate and strain) are established using the dislocation density rate as an internal state variable. Secondly the flow stress model in high temperature deformation process is analyzed for each phase of titanium alloys, in which the flow stress contains a thermal stress and an athermal stress. A {Kock-Mecking} model is adopted to describe the thermally activated stress, and an athermal stress model is established using two-parameter internal state variables. Finally, a constitutive model coupling the grain size, volume fraction and dislocation density is developed based on the microstructure and crystal plasticity models. And, the material constants in present model may be identified by a genetic algorithm {(GA)-based} objective optimization technique. Applying the constitutive model to the isothermal compression of {Ti-6Al-4V} titanium alloy in the deformation temperature ranging from 1093 to1303 K and the strain rate ranging from 0.001 to 10.0 s-1, the 20 material constants in those models are identified with the help of experimental flow stress and grain size of prior [alpha] phase in the isothermal compression of {Ti-6Al-4V} titanium alloy. The relative difference between the predicted and experimental flow stress is 6.13\%, and those of the sampled and the non-sampled grain size are 6.19\% and 7.94\%, respectively.

	abstract = {This paper describes a numerical, hierarchical multiscale modeling methodology involving two distinct bridges over three different length scales that predicts the work hardening of face centered cubic crystals in the absence of physical experiments. This methodology builds a clear bridging approach connecting nano-, micro- and meso-scales. In this methodology, molecular dynamics simulations (nanoscale) are performed to generate mobilities for dislocations. A discrete dislocations numerical tool (microscale) then uses the mobility data obtained from the molecular dynamics simulations to determine the work hardening. The second bridge occurs as the material parameters in a slip system hardening law employed in crystal plasticity models (mesoscale) are determined by the dislocation dynamics simulation results. The material parameters are computed using a correlation procedure based on both the functional form of the hardening law and the internal elastic stress/plastic shear strain fields computed from discrete dislocations. This multiscale bridging methodology was validated by using a crystal plasticity model to predict the mechanical response of an aluminum single crystal deformed under uniaxial compressive loading along the [4 2 1] direction. The computed strain-stress response agrees well with the experimental data.},

	abstract = {Single crystals of {Ti-Al} alloys containing 1.4, 2.9, 5, and 6.6 pct Al (by weight) were oriented for {\textlangle}a{\textrangle} slip on either basal or prism planes or loaded parallel along the c-axis to enforce a nonbasal deformation mode. Most of the tests were conducted in compression and at temperatures between 77 and 1000 K. Trace analysis of prepolished surfaces enabled identification of the twin or slip systems primarily responsible for deformation. Increasing the deformation temperature, Al content, or both, acted to inhibit secondary twin and slip systems, thereby increasing the tendency toward strain accommodation by a single slip system having the highest resolved stress. In the crystals oriented for basal slip, transitions from twinning to multiple slip and, finally, to basal slip occurred with increasing temperature in the {lower-Al-content} alloys, whereas for Ti-6.6 pct Al, only basal slip was observed at all temperatures tested. A comparison of the critically resolved shear stress {(CRSS)} values for basal and prism slip as a function of Al content shows that prism slip is favored at room temperature in pure Ti, but the stress to activate these two systems becomes essentially equal in the Ti-6.6 pct Al crystals over a wide range of temperatures.

Compression tests on crystals oriented so that the load was applied parallel to the c-axis showed extensive twinning in lower Al concentrations and {\textlangle}c+a{\textrangle} slip at higher Al concentrations, with a mixture of {\textlangle}c+a{\textrangle} slip and twinning at intermediate compositions. A few tests also were conducted in tension, with the load applied parallel to the c-axis. In these cases, twinning was observed, and the resolved shear for plastic deformation by twinning was much lower that that for {\textlangle}c+a{\textrangle} slip observed in compression loading.},

In addition, a brief discussion is given of the experimental phenomenology of localized deformation as observed over a range of physical size scales. As summarized, the observations indicate that localized for deformation is, in many cases, caused by micro-fractures that occur during plastic deformation but can also be the natural outcome of large strain deformation process in homogeneous, damage free strain hardening materials.

The iterative approach employed may have trouble achieving convergence in analyses with a highly non-linear material behaviour, such as a crystal plasticity constitutive model. In the case of the explicit {FE} method the solver equations can be solved directly to determine the solution without iteration, thus providing an alternative, more robust method. In this study, a rate-dependent crystal plasticity algorithm was developed for use with the explicit {FE} package, {ABAQUS/explicit.} The subroutine and an equivalent implicit version were used in a series of comparative boundary value problem analyses. The suitability of the implicit and explicit solvers to various loading conditions was assessed and multiple processor speedup rates were also investigated. The results of the study showed that, for simpler loading conditions, the implicit method had a shorter solution time. In the case of loading conditions involving contact, the explicit method proved to be the preferable choice. The explicit method displayed constantly high levels of parallelisation efficiency compared to the implicit method for analyses solved using multiple processors. In conclusion, although the implicit {FE} method is traditionally favoured when solving quasi-static problems, it is important to recognise the advantages that the explicit method has in solving certain loading conditions.},

Two types of morphological arrangement, resulting from edge-to-edge and edge-to-face sympathetic nucleation are clearly identified. The question of whether or not the latter arrangement is formed by branching in the style of solidification dendrities was considered. By expressing the orientation relationship of precipitates in the form of a matrix, a search was made for the relationships which permit branching with equivalent pairs of conjugate habit planes. From the results of such analyses, carried out on commonly observed orientation relationships among f.c.c., b.c.c. and h.c.p. phases, it is concluded that crystallographic constraints essentially prohibit branching in all of these systems. A comparative theoretical study of the relative nucleation kinetics of homogeneous, grain boundary and sympathetic nucleation demonstrated that the activation barrier associated with these processes become comparable when sympathetic nucleation occurs on the terraces of plate shaped precipitate and the matrix:precipitate interface is replaced by a relatively low energy precipitate:precipitate boundary. {TEM} examination of regions in which sympathetic nucleation occurred indicated that the interphase boundaries are invariably replaced by small-angle precipitate:precipitate boundaries essentially in accord with theory.},

Past experiments and analyses are first reviewed to reveal current issues and put the present work in perspective. These issues are addressed by a complete set of simulations of large-strain shear with a finite-strain, rate-dependent polycrystal model. The model is based on a rigorous constitutive theory for crystallographic slip that accounts for the development of crystallographic texture and the effects of texture on constitutive response. The influences of strain hardening, latent hardening, strain-rate sensitivity, boundary constraints, and initial textures on texture evolution and constitutive response are studied. Coupled stress and strain effects such as axial clongation during unconstrained shear and the development of normal stresses during constrained shear are related to material properties, boundary constraint and texture. The formation of ideal textures and their role in determining polycrystalline behaviour is discussed in quantitative terms. Large-strain shear is also studied by using several phenomenological constitutive theories including J\$\_{2}\$-flow theory, J\$\_{2}\$-corner theory, and two versions of finite-strain kinematic hardening theory. The behaviours predicted by these phenomenological theories and the physically based polycrystal model are directly compared. A noteworthy outcome is the close correspondence found between the predictions of J\$\_{2}\$-corner theory and those of the micromechanically based physical model.},

In particular, the effect of slip displacement amplitude and number of fretting cycles on the evolution of grain morphology, grain orientation, misorientation distribution, composition, and microhardness is investigated. The fretting behavior is also related to the macroscopic monotonic and cyclic deformation response. The research goals are accomplished using state-of-the-art surface characterization tools such as orientation image microscopy {(OIM)} using electron backscatter diffraction {(EBSD),} energy dispersive X-ray analysis {(EDX)} and nanoindentation. This study is the first of its kind to use {OIM} to characterize fretting damage and also makes contributions to the body of knowledge about deformation mechanisms in titanium alloys. The results provide a foundation for developing and validating computational crystal plasticity models and their application to fretting and sliding contact problems. New fretting assessment measures have also been identified and have application for components that suffer from fretting wear and/or fatigue related failures.},

The breadth of the length scales naturally enters a more complete material description through the influences that features of the structure of many sizes have on the mechanical responses. The effective inclusion of material structure in simulations is pushing applied plasticity toward more highly quantitative implementations. Computed costs are greater in many respects, but the potential rewards are simulations with much greater relevance to current engineering applications. The focus of this paper is on a number of trends and issues related to these implementations and their use. In particular, we examine the methodologies for describing material structure at multiple scales within the context of simulation and discuss techniques used to compute properties and to evolve the state based on features of the structure.},

It was found, as expected, that the hardness varied with the depth of indentation. Regarding the orientation dependence of hardness, the nature of the statistically stored dislocations as well as that of the geometrically necessary dislocations has been identified. Thus, the occurrence of the majority of the former dislocations can be predicted on the basis of Schmid's law, while noting the presence of minor densities of other dislocations required presumably because of the arbitrary shape change imposed by the nanoindenter. The geometrically necessary dislocations have been identified as the appropriate combinations of slip dislocations such that an overall displacement parallel to the direction of the indentation results.},

During this process, the texture also changes substantially. While the strength, microstructure and formability of {ECAE-deformed} metals have received much attention, texture evolution and its connection with these properties have not. In this article, we cover a multitude of factors that can influence texture evolution, such as applied strain path, die geometry, processing conditions, deformation inhomogeneities, accumulated strain, crystal structure, material plastic behavior, initial texture, dynamic recrystallization, substructure, and deformation twinning. We evaluate current constitutive models for texture evolution based on the physics they include and their agreement with measurements. Last, we discuss the influence of texture on post-processed mechanical response, plastic anisotropy, and grain refinement, properties which have made {ECAE,} as well as other {SPD} processes, attractive.

On the basis of flow stress data obtained as a function of temperature and strain rate in compression, a processing map for hot working has been developed. In the ranges 800-975 {{\textdegree}C} and 3{\texttimes}10-4-10-2 s-1, globularization of lamellae occurs for which an apparent activation energy of 455 {kJ} mol-1 has been estimated using the kinetic rate equation. Stress-dependent thermal activation analyses proposed by Sch\"{o}ck and Cocks et al. have shown that the apparent activation energies are in the range 160-245 {kJ} mol-1 and the normalized activation volumes are in the range 20-80, which suggest that cross-slip is the rate controlling process during globularization. The variation of primary [alpha] grain size with {Zener-Hollomon} parameter {(Z)} in the globularization region exhibited a linear relationship on a log-log scale. At strain rates slower than 10-1 s-1 and temperatures below 900 {{\textdegree}C,} cracking at the prior [beta] grain boundaries/triple junctions occurs, which sets the lower limits for globularization. At strain rates higher than 10-1 s-1 in the [alpha]+[beta] range, the material exhibited flow instabilities manifested as adiabatic shear bands. These bands are intense below 800 {{\textdegree}C} and above 1 s-1 and caused cracking along the bands. In the [beta] phase field, dynamic recrystallization {(DRX)} occurs at about 1100 {{\textdegree}C} and in the strain rate range 10-3-10-1 s-1. The apparent activation energy for {DRX} of [beta] is about 172 {kJ} mol-1 which is close to that for self-diffusion in [beta] phase (153 {kJ} mol-1).

The type of anisotropy considered is that resulting from preferred orientation. A yield criterion is postulated on general grounds which is similar in form to the {Huber-Mises} criterion for isotropic metals, but which contains six parameters specifying the state of anisotropy. By using von Mises' concept (1928) of a plastic potential, associated relations are then found between the stress and strain-increment tensors. The theory is applied to experiments of Korber \& Hoff (1928) on the necking under uniaxial tension of thin strips cut from rolled sheet. It is shown, in full agreement with experimental data, that there are generally two, equally possible, necking directions whose orientation depends on the angle between the strip axis and the rolling direction. As a second example, pure torsion of a thin-walled cylinder is analyzed. With increasing twist anisotropy is developed. In accordance with recent observations by Swift (1947), the theory predicts changes in length of the cylinder. The theory is also applied to determine the earing positions in cups deep-drawn from rolled sheet.},

This derivation also demonstrates that the relatively new hyperspherical harmonic expansion provides access to results that have been inaccessible with the more traditional "generalized spherical harmonic" expansion that is in current use throughout the field.},

Both the Neuber method and non-linear finite element analysis are used to provide numerical values for the stress-strain state at the root of the notched specimens, and hence prediction of fatigue crack initiation lives through correlation with the fatigue criteria. The predictive capability of each criterion is examined and assessed and some of the issues relating to the prediction of initiation of fatigue cracks in notches are highlighted, including the impact of mean stresses, temperature and the accuracy of the Neuber and finite element methods used to model the mechanical response within the notches.},

theory propounded by Eyring in the 1930{\textquoteright}s. The motion of dislocations is governed by thermal activation over potential barriers
produced by obstacles, which may be the crystal lattice itself or other dislocations or defects. Typically, in bcc metals,
the dislocation-lattice interaction is predominant, while in fcc metals, the dislocation-dislocation interaction is the most
significant. When the dislocation-lattice interaction is predominant, the yield stress is temperature and strain rate sensitive,
with essentially athermal strain hardening. When the dislocation-dislocation interaction is predominant, the yield stress
is athermal, with a large temperature and rate sensitive strain hardening. In both cases, a significant part of the athermal
stress is accounted for by grain size effects, and, in some materials, by the effects of deformation twinning. In addition,
some simple strain hardening models are described, starting from a differential equation describing creation and annihilation
of mobile dislocations. Finally, an application of thermal activation theory to polymeric materials is described.},

The interaction law between the macroscopic and local deformations is achieved by a modified Taylor type model in which macroscopic equilibrium and compatibility are maintained, but local compatibility is not considered. Deformations in the constrained directions are posed as Lagrange multipliers rigorously enforcing a minimum work rate throughout the aggregate. The constitutive model is used to predict deformation response and texture evolution in a broad class of low symmetry materials lacking the five independent slip systems required to accommodate a general deformation. The predictions are compared to experimental data for the various materials.

Based on the experimental results in isothermal compression of {Ti-6Al-4V} alloy, the effect of processing parameters and grain size of primary [alpha] phase on the strain rate sensitivity exponent m and the strain hardening exponent n is in depth analyzed. The strain rate sensitivity exponent m at a strain of 0.7 and strain rate of 0.001 s-1 firstly tends to increase with the increasing of deformation temperature, and maximum m value is obtained at deformation temperature close to the beta-transus temperature, while at higher deformation temperature it drops to the smaller values. Moreover, the strain rate sensitivity exponent m decreases with the increasing of strain rate at the deformation temperatures below 1253 K, but the m values become maximal at a strain rate of 0.01 s-1 and the deformation temperature above 1253 K. The strain rate affects the variation of strain rate sensitivity exponent with strain. Those phenomena can be explained reasonably based on the microstructural evolution. On the other hand, the strain hardening exponent n depends strongly on the strain rate at the strains of 0.5 and 0.7. The strain affects significantly the strain hardening exponent n due to the variation of grain size of primary [alpha] phase with strain, and the competition between thermal softening and work hardening.},

The most promising mechanical behavior providing high ultimate tensile strength and ductility is observed in the rolled flow plane samples perpendicular to the rolling direction. Strong in-plane anisotropy in yield strengths of the rolled slabs was observed which cannot be attributed to the sole effect of crystallographic texture. It is suggested that the oriented subgrain/grain boundaries induced by the two-step processing should also play a significant role.

For that purpose, a Ti-64 alloy sheet was 38\% plastically deformed by compression in the [beta] field at {1050{\textdegree}C.} The {ODF} of the [beta] phase at high temperature was determined by an indirect method. Comparison between the experimental texture of the [alpha] phase at room temperature and a simulated texture calculated without variant selection from the high temperature [beta] texture indicated that the phase transformation by cooling occurred with variant selection. By simulating the texture change due to the [beta]-[alpha] transformation we showed that in a first approximation this variant selection can be related to the active slip systems involved in the plastic deformation of the [beta] matrix.},

Slip is assumed to occur on basal and prismatic systems, and dislocation pinning through the generation of geometrically necessary dislocations {(GNDs).} Elastic anisotropy and, through the coupling of {GNDs} with slip rate, physically-based lengthscale effects are included.
A model polycrystal representative of the alloy {Ti-6Al,} which shows creep and strain rate effects at 20 {{\textdegree}C,} is developed and it is shown that the primary effect of elastic anisotropy during subsequent plastic flow is to increase local, grain-level, accumulated slip. Lengthscale effects, however, are shown to lead to quite considerable increases in grain-boundary stresses, and to the re-distribution of accumulated slip local to grain boundaries. In particular, an initially highly non-uniform slip distribution tends to be made more uniform through the hardening effect of sessile {GNDs} at grain boundaries.
The concept of a rogue grain combination is presented; that is, a [`]primary' grain with c-axis orientation at or near parallel to macro-level loading, together with adjacent grains with a prismatic plane orientated at about 70{\textdegree} to the normal to the load direction. This particular combination of orientations leads to the highest stresses normal to the primary basal, together with high levels of accumulated slip in adjacent grains.
The presence of a rogue grain combination in cycles both with and without cold dwell is examined. The cycle with cold dwell is shown to be the more damaging, and a possible criterion for facet nucleation in Ti-alloys is introduced.},

From the measured data, the strain hardening rates were numerically computed, normalized by the shear modulus {(G),} and plotted against both normalized stress and [var epsilon]. These normalized strain hardening plots exhibited three distinct stages of strain hardening that were similar to those observed in previous studies on low stacking fault energy fcc metals (e.g. 70/30 brass) in which deformation twinning has been known to play an important role. Optical microscopy and Orientation imaging microscopy were conducted on samples deformed to different strain levels in the various deformation paths. It was found that the onset of deformation twinning correlated with a sudden increase in strain hardening rate in compression tests. The falling strain hardening rate correlated with saturation in the twin volume fraction. In shear testing a much lower rate of strain hardening was found, at all strains, and this correlated with a lower density of deformation twinning.},

A testing geometry generating controlled and prescribed plastic strains under an imposed stress state close to simple shear was used; this testing procedure used hat-shaped specimens in a compression Kolsky bar which constrains the plastic deformation to a narrow region with approximately 200 [mu]m width. Within this band, localization sets in, initiated at geometrical stress concentration sites, at a shear strain of approximately 1.4. The shear-band widths vary from 3 to 20 [mu]m and increase with plastic strain. High strain-rate deformation induces, at lower plastic strains ([gamma] {\textless} 1.4), planar dislocation arrays and profuse twinning in titanium. In the vicinity of the shear band, elongated cells are formed, which gradually transform into sub-grains. The break-up of these sub-grains inside the band leads to a microstructure composed of small grains ({\textasciitilde} 0.2 [mu]m) with a relatively low dislocation density. The combined effects of plastic strain and temperature on the microstructural recovery processes (dynamic recovery and recrystallization) are discussed. The experimental results are compared with predictions using a phenomenological constitutive equation and parameters obtained from compression experiments conducted over a wide range of strain rates.
The experimental results indicate that the formation of shear bands occurs in two stages: (a) instability, produced by thermal softening and the enhancement of the thermal assistance in the motion of dislocations; (b) localization, which requires softening due to major microstructural changes (recovery and recrystallization) in the material. The calculated temperature rises required for instability and localization are 350 K and 776 K, respectively. Whereas instability may occur homogeneously throughout the entire specimen, localization is an initiation and propagation phenomenon, starting at geometrical (stress concentration sites) or microstructural inhomogeneities and propagating as a thin (3-20 [mu]m) band.},

The aim of the work was to understand more clearly which glide systems are activated during deformation of polycrystalline material and how they are related to the formation of the cold rolling textures. In order to estimate the stresses necessary for the activation of the observed glide systems, the resolved shear stresses for the different deformation systems were calculated from measured crystal orientations. The main results are: in {TiAl6V4} , basal slip has a lower critical resolved shear stress, [tau]c, than prismatic slip. pyramidal glide shows a very low [tau]c, which is up to two times larger than that for prismatic slip. Nevertheless, glide systems were only rarely activated and twinning systems were never activated. Therefore, deformation with c-components may be accommodated by [beta]-phase deformation or grain boundary sliding. The observed c-type texture is due to the strong basal glide. In T40, [tau]c for glide is up to 13 times higher than that for prismatic glide. However, glide and twinning were strongly activated, leading to the observed t-type texture. In T60, the high oxygen content completely suppressed twinning and strongly reduced glide. The less developed t-type texture is due to the combination of and basal glide.},

A combination of microtesting, orientation imaging microscopy, computational simulations, and minimization process, involving genetic algorithms, is implemented in this study for careful characterization and calibration of the material parameters.

The model is used to simulate constant strain rate and creep tests in compression and tension, and the results are compared with experiments.

Different cross-slip scenarios are classified according to different possibilities of re-dissociation of the glide dislocation which has cross-slipped following recombination of the stacking fault. The most important cross-slip models found in literature are reviewed. They fall into one of three main categories: line-tension approximation, linear-elastic treatment with long-distance interaction, and atomistic simulation. Special emphasis is laid on the problem of linear-elastic cutoff radii and critical approach distances and the author's methods of calculating the energy of cross-slip configurations. A critical comparison of different models is made including constriction energies and stress dependence, and the advantages and inherent weaknesses of the different approaches are discussed.},

On the basis of flow stress data obtained as a function of temperature and strain rate in compression, a processing map for hot working has been developed. In the ranges 800-975 {{\textdegree}C} and 3{\texttimes}10-4-10-2 s-1, globularization of lamellae occurs for which an apparent activation energy of 455 {kJ} mol-1 has been estimated using the kinetic rate equation. Stress-dependent thermal activation analyses proposed by Sch\"{o}ck and Cocks et al. have shown that the apparent activation energies are in the range 160-245 {kJ} mol-1 and the normalized activation volumes are in the range 20-80, which suggest that cross-slip is the rate controlling process during globularization. The variation of primary [alpha] grain size with {Zener-Hollomon} parameter {(Z)} in the globularization region exhibited a linear relationship on a log-log scale. At strain rates slower than 10-1 s-1 and temperatures below 900 {{\textdegree}C,} cracking at the prior [beta] grain boundaries/triple junctions occurs, which sets the lower limits for globularization. At strain rates higher than 10-1 s-1 in the [alpha]+[beta] range, the material exhibited flow instabilities manifested as adiabatic shear bands. These bands are intense below 800 {{\textdegree}C} and above 1 s-1 and caused cracking along the bands. In the [beta] phase field, dynamic recrystallization {(DRX)} occurs at about 1100 {{\textdegree}C} and in the strain rate range 10-3-10-1 s-1. The apparent activation energy for {DRX} of [beta] is about 172 {kJ} mol-1 which is close to that for self-diffusion in [beta] phase (153 {kJ} mol-1). The application of these results in the design of bulk metalworking processes for achieving microstructural control is discussed.},

Polycrystal plasticity simulations are used to model the observed anisotropy and texture evolution. Strong in-plane anisotropy observed at low temperatures is attributed to the initial texture and the greater than anticipated non-basal cross-slip of dislocations with type Burgers vectors. The agreement between the measured and simulated anisotropy and texture is further validated by direct observations of the dislocation microstructures using transmission electron microscopy. The increase in the ductility with temperature is accompanied by a decrease in the flow stress, an increase in the strain rate sensitivity, and a decrease in the normal anisotropy. Polycrystal simulations indicate that an increased activity of non-basal, , dislocations provides a self-consistent explanation for the observed changes in the anisotropy with increasing temperature.},

	abstract = {Abstract  The deformation and dynamic recrystallization behavior of Waspaloy-ingot material with coarse, columnar grains was established
using isothermal uniaxial and double-cone compression tests. Testing was conducted along different test directions relative
to the columnar-grain microstructure at supersolvus temperatures (1066 C and 1177 C) and strain rates (0.005 and 0.1 s-1), which bracket typical ingot-breakdown conditions for the material. The flow behavior of axial samples (i.e., those compressed parallel to the columnar-grain direction) showed an initial strain-hardening transient followed by steady-state
flow. In contrast, the stress-strain curves of samples upset transverse to the columnar grains exhibited a peak stress at low strains, whose magnitude was greater than the steady-state flow stress
of the axial samples, followed by flow softening. The two distinct flow behaviors were explained on the basis of the solidification
texture associated with the starting ingot structure, differences in the kinetics of dynamic recrystallization revealed in
the double-cone tests, and the evolution of deformation and recrystallization textures during hot working. Dynamic recrystallization
kinetics were measurably faster for the transverse samples as well as specimens oriented at \~{}45 deg to the forging direction,
an effect partially rationalized based on the initial texture and its effect on the input rate of deformation work driving
recrystallization. Despite these differences, the overall strains required for dynamic recrystallization were comparable to
those measured previously for fine-grain (wrought) Waspaloy. However, the Avrami exponents (\~{}2 to 3) were somewhat higher
than those for wrought material (\~{}1 to 2), an effect attributable to the particle-stimulated nucleation in the ingot material.},

For this purpose, a processing map has been developed on the basis of flow stress data as a function of temperature, strain rate and strain. The map exhibited two domains: (i) the domain in the [alpha]-[beta] phase field is identified to represent fine-grained superplasticity and the peak efficiency of power dissipation occurred at about {825{\textdegree}C/0.0003} s-1. At this temperature, the hot ductility exhibited a sharp peak indicating that the superplasticity process is very sensitive to temperature. The [alpha] grain size increased exponentially with increase in temperature in this domain and the variation is similar to the increase in the [beta] volume fraction in this alloy. At the temperature of peak ductility, the volume fraction of [beta] is about 20\%, suggesting that sliding of [alpha]-[alpha] interfaces is primarily responsible for superplasticity while the [beta] phase present at the grain boundary triple junctions restricts grain growth. The apparent activation energy estimated in the [alpha]-[beta] superplasticity domain is about 330 {kJ} mol-1, which is much higher than that for self diffusion in [alpha]-titanium. (ii) In the [beta] phase field, the alloy exhibits dynamic recrystallization and the variation of grain size with temperature and strain rate could be correlated with the {Zener-Hollomon} parameter. The apparent activation energy in this domain is estimated to be 210 {kJ} mol-1, which is close to that for self diffusion in [beta]. At temperatures around the transus, a ductility peak with unusually high ductility has been observed, which has been attributed to the occurrence of transient superplasticity of [beta] in view of its fine grain size. The material exhibited flow instabilities at strain rates higher than about 1 s-1 and these are manifested as adiabatic shear bands in the [alpha]-[beta] regime.},

Different loading conditions are applied in order to get the comprehensive response of the alloy. The strain rates are varied from the quasi-static to dynamic regimes and the corresponding material responses are obtained. The specimen is deformed to large strains in order to study the material behavior under finite deformation at various strain rates. Torsional Kolsky bar is used to achieve shear strain rates up to 1000 s-1. Experiments are performed under non-proportional loading conditions as well as dynamic torsion followed by dynamic compression at various temperatures. The non-proportional loading experiments comprise of an initial uniaxial loading to a certain level of strain followed by biaxial loading, using a channel-type die at various rates of loadings. All the non-proportional experiments are carried out at room temperature. Experiments are also performed to investigate the anisotropic behavior of the alloy.

Based on the definition of the effective stress of this yield criterion, the observed material response for the different loading conditions under large deformation is modeled using the {Khan-Huang-Liang} {(KHL)} equation assuming isotropic hardening.

The plastic flow is modelled as rate-insensitive, and localization, viewed as a bifurcation from a homogeneous deformation mode to one which is concentrated in a narrow [`]shear band', is found to be possible only when the plastic hardening modulus for the slip system has fallen to a certain critical value hcr, sensitive to the precise form of the constitutive law governing incremental shear. We develop the general form of this constitutive law, incorporating within it the possibility of deviations from the Schmid rule of a critical resolved shear stress, and we show that hcr may in fact be positive when there are deviations from the Schmid rule. It is suggested that micromechanical processes such as [`]cross-slip' in crystals provide specific cases for which stresses other than the Schmid stress may influence plastic response and, further, there is an experimental association of localization with the onset of large amounts of cross-slip. Thus, we give the specific form of hcr for a constitutive model that corresponds to {non-Schmid} effects in cross-slip, and we develop a dislocation model of the process from which we estimate the magnitude of the parameters involved. The work supports the notion that localization can occur with positive strain-hardening, hcr {\textgreater} 0, and the often invoked notions of the attainment of an ideally-plastic or strain-softening state for localization may be unnecessary.},

They are used to model individual physical parameters of microstructure, such as grain size evolution in static and dynamic conditions, dislocation density accumulation and recovery, recrystallisation, dissolving rate of precipitates. Techniques have been introduced to incorporate mechanism-based microstructure parameters into a viscoplastic flow model to form a set of unified viscoplastic constitutive equations, which are implemented into {FE} solvers, through user defined subroutines, to simulate microstructure evolution in hot forming processes. Three examples are detailed in this paper. They are modelling of grain growth in superplastic forming, modelling of microstructure evolution in hot rolling and dissolving of precipitates in solution heat treatment {(SHT)} and their effects on viscoplastic flow of an Al-alloy.},

	abstract = {Abstract  The deformation and dynamic recrystallization behavior of Waspaloy-ingot material with coarse, columnar grains was established
using isothermal uniaxial and double-cone compression tests. Testing was conducted along different test directions relative
to the columnar-grain microstructure at supersolvus temperatures (1066 C and 1177 C) and strain rates (0.005 and 0.1 s-1), which bracket typical ingot-breakdown conditions for the material. The flow behavior of axial samples (i.e., those compressed parallel to the columnar-grain direction) showed an initial strain-hardening transient followed by steady-state
flow. In contrast, the stress-strain curves of samples upset transverse to the columnar grains exhibited a peak stress at low strains, whose magnitude was greater than the steady-state flow stress
of the axial samples, followed by flow softening. The two distinct flow behaviors were explained on the basis of the solidification
texture associated with the starting ingot structure, differences in the kinetics of dynamic recrystallization revealed in
the double-cone tests, and the evolution of deformation and recrystallization textures during hot working. Dynamic recrystallization
kinetics were measurably faster for the transverse samples as well as specimens oriented at \~{}45 deg to the forging direction,
an effect partially rationalized based on the initial texture and its effect on the input rate of deformation work driving
recrystallization. Despite these differences, the overall strains required for dynamic recrystallization were comparable to
those measured previously for fine-grain (wrought) Waspaloy. However, the Avrami exponents (\~{}2 to 3) were somewhat higher
than those for wrought material (\~{}1 to 2), an effect attributable to the particle-stimulated nucleation in the ingot material.},

	title = {Three Dimensional Modeling of {Ti-Al} Alloys with Application to Attachment Fatigue},
	abstract = {The increasing use of  {Ti-Al} alloys in critical aircraft gas turbine engine and airframe applications necessitates the further development of physically-based constitutive models that account for their complex microdeformation mechanisms.  Alpha/beta {Ti-Al} alloys are dual-phase in nature consisting of a mixture of hcp () and bcc () crystal structures, which through variation in alloying elements and/or processing techniques can be produced in a wide range of microstructural compositions and morphologies.  A constitutive model for these materials should address the various sources of material anisotropy and heterogeneity at both the micro and macroscales. The main sources of anisotropy in these materials are the low symmetry of the hcp phase, the texture, the relative strengths of different slip systems, non-planar dislocation core structures, phase distributions, and dislocation substructure evolution. 
	The focus of this work is the development of a {3-D} crystal plasticity model for duplex {Ti-6Al-4V} {(Ti-64),} an  alloy.  The model is used to study the process of attachment fatigue.  Attachment fatigue is a boundary layer phenomenon in which most of the plastic deformation and damage accumulation occurs at depths on the order of tens of microns and encompasses regions of only a few grains into the depth of the material.  The use of computational micromechanics-based crystal plasticity models to study attachment fatigue is a relatively new approach. This approach has the potential to offer additional insight to classical homogeneous plasticity models, since the length scales over which relative slip and crack initiation occur during this process is on the order of microstructural dimensions.  Emphasis is placed on understanding the effects that texture, slip strength anisotropy, and phase distribution have on the surface and subsurface deformation fields during attachment fatigue.  The deformation fields are quantified in terms of cumulative effective plastic strain distributions and plastic strain maps.
	The results clearly demonstrate the importance of considering the various sources of microstructural heterogeneity during the process of fretting fatigue.  The main sources of microstructural heterogeneity in these materials are the distribution of phases, slip system strength anisotropy, and crystallographic texture.  The necessity of including realistic {3-D} textures is especially underscored in this work as the distribution and cyclic behavior of the plastic strain can be fundamentally different for different types of textured materials.  If is shown that basal textured materials, in which a large number of grains in the polycrystal are able to deform by soft slip modes, that the plastic strain distributions are more evenly distributed in the subsurface regions and as a result have less intense regions of significant plastic strain accumulation.  However, the sharper transverse and basal / transverse textured materials feature subsurface plastic zones in which the plastic strain accumulates in narrow vein-like structures leading to more intense regions of cumulative effective plastic strain.
	Similarly, the texture of the material is observed to influence the cyclic plastic strain behavior.  Due to the homogeneous distribution of plastic strain for the basal textured material, the majority of the plastic zone has already reached a state of elastic shakedown by the start of the 3rd tangential loading cycle, which is indicative of the more uniform distribution of residual stresses that develop for this type of textured material.  However, the transverse and basal / transverse textured materials still show that a large portion of the plastic zone is still deforming via cyclic plastic ratcheting over the 3rd tangential loading cycle.  Again, this is a result of the sharper nature of these type of textures in which a relatively small number of banded regions in the plastic zone are accommodating a majority of the plastic deformation.  This heterogeneous distribution of deformation leads to the more pronounced plastic ratcheting for these types textures.  These fundamental differences in cyclic plastic strain behavior due to the influence of microstructural heterogeneity emphasize the importance of this work, and the need for continued study of the process of fretting fatigue with physically-based micromechanical models.},

	abstract = {The mechanical behavior of a commercially pure titanium {(CP-Ti)} is systematically investigated in quasi-static {(Instron,} servohydraulic) and dynamic {(UCSD's} recovery Hopkinson) compression. Strains over 40\% are achieved in these tests over a temperature range of 77-1000 K and strain rates of 10-3-8000/s. At the macroscopic level, the flow stress of {CP-Ti,} within the plastic deformation regime, is strongly dependent on the temperature and strain rate, and displays complex variations with strain, strain rate, and temperature. In particular, there is a three-stage deformation pattern at a temperature range from 296 to 800 K, the specific range depending on the strain rate. In an effort to understand the underlying mechanisms, a number of interrupted tests involving temperature jumps are performed, and the resulting microstructures are characterized using an optical microscope. Based on the experimental results and simple estimates, it is concluded that the three-stage pattern of deformation at temperatures from 296 to 800 K, is a result of dynamic strain aging, through the directional diffusion of dislocation-core point defects with the moving dislocation at high strain rates, although the usual dynamic strain aging by point defects segregating outside the dislocation core through volume diffusion is also observed at low strain rates and high temperatures. The microscopic analysis shows that there is substantial deformation twinning which cannot be neglected in modeling the plastic flow of {CP-Ti.} The density of twins increases markedly with increasing strain rate, strain, and decreasing temperature. Twin intersections occur, and become more pronounced at low temperatures or high strain rates. In sum, the true stress-true strain curves of {CP-Ti} show two stages of deformation pattern at low temperatures, three stages at temperatures above 296 K, and only one stage at temperatures exceeding 800 K, although all three stages may exist even at 1000 K for very high strain rates, e.g. 8000/s. While the dislocation motion is still the main deformation mechanism for plastic flow, the experimental results suggest that dynamic strain aging should be taken into account, as well as the effect of deformation twinning.},

The constitutive equations have been implemented in a finite element program, and the computational capability is used to simulate the evolution of crystallographic texture in simple compression, plane-strain compression, and torsion under quasi-static conditions. A comparison of the predictions against corresponding experiments shows that the crystal plasticity-based model predicts the texture evolution and the macroscopic stress-strain curves satisfactorily. The computational capability is also used to simulate the dynamic Taylor rod-impact tests performed by Ting (1992) on pre-textured tantalum cylinders.

The key problem of the rate-independent formulation of single crystal plasticity is the possible occurrence of redundant constraints due to linear-dependent active slip systems. This results in a possible non-uniqueness of the set of active slip systems. In order to overcome this problem, we propose here in line with recent research developments a solution procedure for the determination of the incremental active slips based on a particularly chosen generalized inverse of the Jacobian of the active yield criterion functions. The performance and physical acceptance of the proposed formulation is demonstrated for two representative numerical model problems.},

Effect of the strain on the flow stress, the grain size and the apparent activation energy for deformation of isothermally compressed {Ti-6Al-4V} alloy is analyzed. The results show that the apparent activation energy for deformation and the grain size of isothermally compressed {Ti-6Al-4V} alloy in the [alpha] + [beta] two-phase region vary slightly with strain: the activation energy increases with strain after an early drop as the primary [alpha] grain size varies with strain. On the other hand, the apparent activation energy for deformation of isothermally compressed {Ti-6Al-4V} alloy in the [beta] single-phase region increases firstly with the increasing of strain and then does that slightly in the strain range from 0.3 to 0.7. A processing map of the isothermally compressed {Ti-6Al-4V} alloy is constructed at a strain of 0.6. The processing map of isothermally compressed {Ti-6Al-4V} alloy exhibits that the optimal processing parameters are the deformation temperature of 1143 K and the strain rate of 0.001 s-1. Meanwhile, two instability domains in the processing map of isothermally compressed {Ti-6Al-4V} alloy are as follows: one is in the deformation temperature range from 1093 K to 1183 K and the strain rate range from 0.011 s-1 to 2.02 s-1, and another is in the deformation temperature range from 1243 K to 1303 K and the strain rate range from 1.0 s-1 to 10.0 s-1.},

Fourier-type series expansion methods which use spherical harmonic library functions as well as the direct pole figure inversion methods are not well suited to reproduce texture information in a sufficiently localized spherical form onto finite element grids. Mathematically compact Gauss-shaped spherical texture components represent a better approach for including textures in finite element models since they represent an excellent compromise between discreteness (spherical localization), compactness (simple functions), mathematical precision (very good approximation also of complex orientation distribution functions already with small sets of texture components), scalability (the number of used texture components can be systematically varied according to the desired exactness of the texture fit), conceptual simplicity (simple mathematical handling), and physical significance (texture components can be directly linked to characteristic metallurgical mechanisms). The use of texture component functions has also advantages over the use of large sets of discrete single orientations with equal scatter and height since they are more compact, practical, and provide better physical insight into microstructural mechanisms and composition sensitive effects. The article presents a new approach for the mathematical reproduction of such crystallographic texture components in crystal plasticity finite element simulations. It explains in some detail why they are particularly suited for this purpose and how they can be used to map and recover textures in/from plasticity simulations.},

The parameters appearing in the crystal-plasticity materials constitutive relations are assessed using the available experimental information pertaining to the active slip systems, their deformation resistances and hardening and rate behavior of the two constitutive phases both in their single-crystalline and in polysynthetically-twinned lamellar forms. The constitutive relations are implemented in a Vectorized User Material Subroutine {(VUMAT)} of the commercial finite element program {Abaqus/Explicit} within which the material state is integrated during loading using an explicit Euler-forward formulation.

For example, inclined [alpha]-plates may share common basal planes and be related by a rotation of [small tilde]10.5{\textdegree} about the c-axis of the crystals. This phenomenon has been interpreted on the basis of variant selection of the Burgers orientation relationship commonly adopted between the [alpha] and [beta] phases in these alloys.

Metals deforming plastically through dislocation motion are of this class and form the primary application of the theory. The development is in terms of a general internal-variable thermodynamic formalism for description of the microstructural rearrangements, and it is shown how metal plasticity may be so characterized.
The principal result is in the normality structure which is shown to arise in macroscopic constitutive laws when each of the local microstructural rearrangements proceeds at a rate governed by its associated thermodynamic force. This provides a theoretical framework for time-dependent inelastic behavior in terms of a "flow potential", and reduces to statements on normality of strain increments to yield surfaces in the time-independent case. Conventional characterizations of the stress-state dependence of metallic slip are noted to be in accord with this concept of associated forces governing rates, so that the resulting normality structure may be considered directly applicable to metal plasticity.},

	abstract = {We focus on challenges in advancing the modeling of plastic flow processes to incorporate distinct characteristics of various length scales within materials and structures. The motivation is twofold. First, the goal of tailoring the material microstructure to control plastic deformation and related failure processes is of great economic importance. Product development cycles have become so short that traditional empirical approaches to alloy modification are noncompetitive in the global marketplace. Second, materials selection and design for durability, which rests upon our understanding of phenomena occurring at microstructural scales as well as at the scale of structural components, is of critical importance as we head into an era where an extensive infrastructure must be maintained. Cost constraints on new systems dictate much more quantitative design and analysis procedures than in the past. Research needs are discussed in a number of key areas involving experiments and modeling, including: experiments conducted at multiple length scales of resolution; principles for multiscale modeling and scale effects in plasticity; coupling of plasticity-induced damage with texture and phase transformations; progressive cyclic deformation and failure; microstructure-scale plasticity of cast alloys and low symmetry polycrystals; and employment of massively parallel computing to determine model parameters and forms of evolution equations for internal structure variables.},

Noticeable differences were found in the grain-growth behaviors of the two lots of material with one exhibiting much smaller grain sizes than the other for a given set of processing conditions. A semi-quantitative analysis of the results revealed that the two batches of alloy had similar grain-growth exponents and activation energies but different rate constants. These trends were explained in terms of the beta-phase textures in the as-received materials which persisted during beta annealing. The former material had a moderate strength, cube-like texture, whereas the latter lot of material exhibited a very strong and sharper fiber texture. The grain-growth results were thus explained in terms of the effect of texture on grain-boundary surface energy/mobility.},

	abstract = {The mechanical properties of nanocrystalline materials are reviewed, with emphasis on their constitutive response and on the fundamental physical mechanisms. In a brief introduction, the most important synthesis methods are presented. A number of aspects of mechanical behavior are discussed, including the deviation from the {Hall-Petch} slope and possible negative slope, the effect of porosity, the difference between tensile and compressive strength, the limited ductility, the tendency for shear localization, the fatigue and creep responses. The strain-rate sensitivity of {FCC} metals is increased due to the decrease in activation volume in the nanocrystalline regime; for {BCC} metals this trend is not observed, since the activation volume is already low in the conventional polycrystalline regime. In fatigue, it seems that the {S-N} curves show improvement due to the increase in strength, whereas the {da/dN} curve shows increased growth velocity (possibly due to the smoother fracture requiring less energy to propagate). The creep results are conflicting: while some results indicate a decreased creep resistance consistent with the small grain size, other experimental results show that the creep resistance is not negatively affected. Several mechanisms that quantitatively predict the strength of nanocrystalline metals in terms of basic defects (dislocations, stacking faults, etc.) are discussed: break-up of dislocation pile-ups, core-and-mantle, grain-boundary sliding, grain-boundary dislocation emission and annihilation, grain coalescence, and gradient approach. Although this classification is broad, it incorporates the major mechanisms proposed to this date. The increased tendency for twinning, a direct consequence of the increased separation between partial dislocations, is discussed. The fracture of nanocrystalline metals consists of a mixture of ductile dimples and shear regions; the dimple size, while much smaller than that of conventional polycrystalline metals, is several times larger than the grain size. The shear regions are a direct consequence of the increased tendency of the nanocrystalline metals to undergo shear localization.
The major computational approaches to the modeling of the mechanical processes in nanocrystalline metals are reviewed with emphasis on molecular dynamics simulations, which are revealing the emission of partial dislocations at grain boundaries and their annihilation after crossing them.},

By means of a modified Hill's self-consistent relation the local stress of a grain is calculated, and used in conjunction with this constitutive equation to evaluate the plastic strain of each constituent grain. The grain-size effect on the plastic flow of polycrystals then can be determined by an averaging process. To check the validity of the proposed theory it was finally applied to predict the stress-strain curves and flow stresses of a copper at various grain-sizes. The obtained results were found to be in good agreement with experimental data.},

The non-monotonic temperature dependence of deforming stresses, which is inconsistent with the conventional thermal fluctuation concepts of the plastic deformation process, is considered along with the plastic flow instability appearing as drops of load in the stress-strain curve, and a low temperature increase in plasticity of the metals studied.
The analysis of the effects of alloying, preliminary strain and sample sizes on the plastic flow instability parameters (onset temperature, amplitude and number of load drops) has shown that this may be accounted for by a combination of hypotheses of the dislocation array overcoming a barrier and the following local heating which results in a drop of load in the stress-strain curve.
It has been found that substitution elements at concentrations corresponding to a homogeneous solid solution do not affect the usual behaviour of temperature dependence of yield stress O0.2 typical of high purity titanium. The presence of the second phase due to high concentrations of the above elements reverses the sign of the {do0.2/dT} derivative. Abov certain concentrations of oxygen atoms forming an interstitial solid solution, it becomes temperature independent. The comparison between the derived experimental results and theoretical concepts available shows that the former make allowance for increasing importance of the inertial mechanism of overcoming pinning centres by dislocations at low temperatures.
The observed increase in plasticity of titanium and its alloys based on solid solutions at 40-120 K is attributed to a combined action of two deformation mechanisms - slip and lower temperature activated twinning.},

Numerical examples are used to show the application of the methodology for modeling deformation processes.},

Herein, changes in the distribution and mode of cyclic microplasticity with respect to different representative {3-D} textures are examined and compared to observations from simulations using the {2-D} slip geometry. Results are discussed and quantified in terms of cumulative effective plastic strain distributions, plastic strain maps, and the effective ratchet strain increments.},

	volume = {121},
	doi = {10.1115/1.2812370},
	abstract = {Since the 1960s, it has been known that elastoplastic polycrystal models predict asymmetries in the yield strength for polycrystals that have been prestrained. After prestraining in tension, a model polycrystal exhibits Bauschinger-like behavior in that it yields in compression at a lower stress magnitude than in tension. Furthermore, the knee of the reloading stress-strain curve is more gradual for compression than for tension. The origins of these behaviors reside in the assumption that links the macroscopic deformation to the deformations in individual crystals. More precisely, the reloading response is biased by the residual stress field which is induced with plastic straining by the anisotropy of the single crystal yield surface. While the earlier work pointed to the polycrystalline origins of the asymmetry, it did not resolve the degree to which the particular linking assumption affects the amount of asymmetry. However, due to the strong influence of the linking assumption on the crystal stresses,  the sensitivity of the asymmetry to the linking assumption is expected to be appreciable. In this paper we examine the influence of the linking assumption on the magnitude of the computed yield strength asymmetry of prestrained polycrystals. Elastoplastic polycrystal simulations based on upper bound {(Taylor)} and lower bound (equilibrium-based) linking assumptions are compared to finite element computations in  which elements constitute individual crystals. The finite element model maintains compatibility while satisfying equilibrium in a weak sense and treats the influence of neighboring crystals explicitly. The strength of the predicted Bauschinger effect does depend on the linking assumption, with 'compatibility first' models developing stronger yield strength asymmetries.},

Stress and strain transformation equations are coupled with orthotropic plasticity theory1 when the stress ratio remains constant. Three limit strains, two normal and one shear, appear in the material axes at diffuse instability. These strains define a forming limit diagram {(FLD)} which rotates, with increasing [theta], about its pole. Shear strains reach a maximum for [theta] = 45 {\textdegree} but are absent for [theta] = 0 and 90 {\textdegree}. A simpler plane presentation of the {FLD} appears in axes of major and minor principal plastic strains. This shows that the sensitivity of the {FLD} to orientation depends upon the r-values. Examples are given of 1. (i) a {CR} steel whose r-values exceed unity but where r1 {\textasciitilde}- r2, i.e., where only a slight deviation exists between the principal axes of stress and strain and2. (ii) a 6000 aluminium alloy whose r values are different and less than unity. The observations made provide a mathematical model of the experimental {Keeler-Goodwin} {FLD2,3.} The use of thickness strain for one axis of the {FLD} is also considered for when ultrasonic thickness monitoring is more convenient than surface strain measurement. Fracture strain data from bulge forming, punch indentation, and Ericksen tests fall around the limit lines predicted by a diffuse instability model in the region of most interest to users.},

The materials analyzed consist of micron scale grains having either one or three slip systems and two types of grain arrangements: either a checker-board pattern or randomly dispersed with a specified volume fraction. Calculations are carried out for materials with either a high density of dislocation sources or a low density of dislocation sources. In all cases, the grain boundaries are taken to be impenetrable to dislocations. A {Hall-Petch} type relation is predicted with {Hall-Petch} exponents ranging from [approximate]0.3 to [approximate]1.6 depending on the number of slip systems, the grain arrangement, the dislocation source density and the range of grain sizes to which a {Hall-Petch} expression is fit.

Dislocation glide and deformation twinning are dissipative, while energy storage mechanisms associated with dislocation lines and twin boundaries are described via scalar internal state variables. Concepts from continuum crystal plasticity are invoked, with shearing rates on discrete glide and twinning systems modelled explicitly. The model describes aspects of thermomechanical behaviour of single crystals of alumina over a range of loading conditions. Resolved shear stresses necessary for glide or twin nucleation at low to moderate temperatures are estimated from nonlinear elastic calculations, theoretical considerations of Peierls barriers and stacking fault energies and observations from shock physics experiments. These estimates are combined with the existing data from high-temperature experiments to provide initial yield conditions spanning a wide range of temperatures. The model reflects hardening of glide and twin systems from dislocations accumulated during basal slip. Residual elastic volume changes, predicted from nonlinear elastic considerations and approximated dislocation line energies, are positive and proportional to the dislocation line density. While the model suggests that generation of very large dislocation densities could influence the pressure{\textendash}volume response, volume increases from defects are predicted to be small in crystals deformed via basal glide on a single system.},

These analyses show that in regions where both prism and basal slip systems were not operational, macro shear bands developed, leading to kinked lamellar microstructural features.

Therefore, this method is particularly useful in providing insight into alloy design when empirical potentials are not available or not reliable for such multi-element systems. The model is applied to study the external stress assisted dislocation cross-slip and constriction process in two fcc metals, Al and Ag, exhibiting different deformation properties. We find that the screw dislocation in Al can cross-slip spontaneously in contrast with that in Ag, where the screw dislocation splits into two partials that cannot cross-slip without first being constricted.

Discrete atomic scale mechanisms associated with dislocation nucleation are incorporated into a first-order constitutive model for the tensile strength of tilt boundaries. This work provides a detailed understanding of the influence of boundary structure on dislocation nucleation, which is critical for the advancement of grain boundary engineering concepts. Finally, the influence of the lattice orientation on atomistic simulations of homogeneous dislocation nucleation in single crystals is discussed.},

	abstract = {To bridge length scales in plastic flow of polycrystalline fcc metals,
the salient features of {3D} polycrystalline elastoviscoplasticity at
the crystal level (mesoscale) were studied to determine the relative
influences on macroscale behaviour. This {3D} study builds upon the {2D}
planar double-slip analysis performed by Horstemeyer and {McDowell} in
which the relative influence of the constitutive-law features on
macroscale properties in polycrystal plasticity were quantified for
oxygen-free, high-conductivity copper. The mesoscale constitutive-law
features considered include single-crystal elastic properties,
slip-system-level hardening law, latent hardening, slip-system-level
kinematic hardening, and intergranular constraint relation.
Volume-averaged macroscale responses included the effective flow
stress, plastic spin, elastic moduli, hardening behaviour, and axial
extension (for the free-end torsion case). Each response was evaluated
at 10\% and 50\% effective strain levels under rectilinear shear
straining. In the existing literature, only one type of behaviour
(e.g. texture or stress-strain response) is typically considered when
assessing these various elements of the constitutive framework. In
this paper, we develop a more comprehensive understanding of the
relative importance of constitutive-law features as deformation
proceeds. This study suggests that the design of experiments
methodology is a valuable tool to assist in selecting relevant
features for polycrystalline simulations and for development of
macroscale unified-creep-plasticity models. In general, the results
indicated that the intergranular constraint and kinematic hardening
were more influential overall than the type of constitutive model
used, whether isotropic or anisotropic elasticity was used, and
whether or not latent hardening was used. Finally, {3D} results were
similar to the previous {2D} planar double-slip study of Horstemeyer and
{McDowell,} except that latent hardening had a stronger influence on the
{3D} macroscale responses than the {2D} macroscale responses.},

The first aspect is the measurement and mathematical treatment of flow stress data, where the main issue is the compensation of adiabatic heating, friction and heterogeneous deformation. A procedure for performing these corrections is presented in this paper. The second aspect is the development of a physically based constitutive model, capable of tracing characteristic variables of state trough a multiple-pass rolling schedule in order to fully describe the forming history of a given material element. A four-internal-state-variable model {(4IVM)} is developed which computes the development of edge and screw dislocations both in the cell walls and interiors during forming and during holding times at elevated temperature. The magnitude of flow stress is derived from these internal variables. Furthermore, the current dislocation density is taken as driving force for recrystallisation, causing a coupling of recovery and recrystallisation mechanisms. Recrystallised fractions, originated at different points of time, are treated as individual substructures in subsequent deformation steps. Thus, the interactions of strain hardening, dynamic and static recovery and recrystallisation are formulated and collectively affect the flow stress.
The effect of using the derived constitutive model within the thermal and mechanical simulation of rolling operations is shown by application to rolling trials on a laboratory mill and on an industrial four-stand mill by the example of alloy {AA3104.}},

	abstract = {To quantify the effects of interactions between various microstructure attributes on fatigue life in the high cycle fatigue {(HCF)} regime, we have proposed a new microstructure-sensitive extreme value statistical framework. This framework couples the extreme value distributions of certain fatigue indicator parameters {(FIPs)} or response functions to the correlated microstructure attributes that exist at the extreme value locations of these {FIPs.} We demonstrate the application of this statistical framework to investigate the microstructure-sensitive fatigue response of the {PM} Ni-base superalloy {IN100} at 650 {{\textdegree}C.} To accomplish this task, we construct statistical volume elements {(SVEs)} used to compute the local response for 200 instantiations of {IN100.} These {SVEs} are constructed and simulated via the finite element method with crystal plasticity constitutive relations. The results of the simulations are used to explore extreme value statistics of the {FIPs} for these microstructures. The extreme value distributions of the {Fatemi-Socie} {FIP} are fit with high confidence by the Gumbel distribution and are defined in a representative nature with as few as 25 simulated microstructure instantiations (i.e., {SVEs).} The extreme value marked correlation functions of the apparent Schmid factor based on the geometry of the slip systems relative to the loading direction indicate that cube slip may be important to fatigue crack formation in this material system. This supports previous experimental observations of fatigue crack formation and microstructurally small fatigue crack growth along cube planes in {IN100} in grains that are unfavorably oriented for octahedral slip at elevated temperatures.},

The paper gives a short review of applications and adaptation of this rule to experimental observations on titanium alloys.
The problem with this approach and its modifications is that it does not consider adequately the great variety of possible microstructural interaction mechanisms, which depend on factors such as phase morphology, crystallographic relationship between different phases, work hardening characteristics etc. The importance of these aspects for multiphase behaviour will be demonstrated by two examples, namely: strength and flow in a system with two ductile components; and flow and work hardening of a ductile matrix with hard lamellar inclusions. This view shows that for an adequate description of a given material an individual adaptation to the particular ruling mechanisms, which vary from case to case, is necessary.},

	abstract = {The effect of alpha platelet thickness on the plastic flow of {Ti-6Al-4V} with a transformed microstructure was established by conducting isothermal, hot compression tests at hot working temperatures on samples with identical crystallographic texture and beta grain size. Microstructures containing alpha laths/platelets ranging in thickness from approximately 0.4 to 10 [mu]m were produced by various sequences consisting of hot rolling and heat treatment. Constant-strain-rate and strain-rate-jump compression tests were conducted at subtransus temperatures of 815, 900, and {955{\textdegree}C} in the strain rate regime between 10-3 and 10 s-1. The rate-jump tests suggested that plastic flow is controlled by a power-law creep (dislocation glide/climb) mechanism in all cases except the low-strain rate deformation of material with the thinnest alpha laths. All of the constant-strain-rate compression tests yielded flow curves consisting of a peak stress at low strains ({\textless}=0.03), extensive flow softening, and a steady-state flow stress at large strains. The peak stress results indicated a significant {Hall-Petch} dependence on alpha lath/platelet thickness at the two lower test temperatures. The magnitude of this dependence was predicted by the classical Eshelby expression for grain-size strengthening. In addition, a first-order analysis demonstrated that the observed flow softening is of the same magnitude as that which would be associated with the loss of {Hall-Petch} strengthening (due to alpha-beta interfaces) during hot working.},
