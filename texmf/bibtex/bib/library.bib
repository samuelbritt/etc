abstract = {Telemedicine has the potential to help facilitate the delivery of health services to rural areas. In the right circumstances, telemedicine may also be useful for the delivery of education and teaching programmes and the facilitation of administrative meetings. In this paper reference is made to a variety of telemedicine applications in Australia and other countries including telepaediatrics, home telehealth, critical care telemedicine for new born babies, telemedicine in developing countries, health screening via e-mail, and teleradiology. These applications represent some of the broad range of telemedicine applications possible. An overriding imperative is to focus on the clinical problem first with careful consideration given to the significant organisational changes which are associated with the introduction of a new service or alternative method of service delivery. For telemedicine to be effective it is also important that all sites involved are adequately resourced in terms of staff, equipment, telecommunications, technical support and training. In addition, there are a number of logistical factors which are important when considering the development of a telemedicine service including site selection, clinician empowerment, telemedicine management, technological requirements, user training, telemedicine evaluation, and information sharing through publication.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE--To determine whether a system of telemedicine support can improve glycemic control in type 1 diabetes.  RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--A 9-month randomized trial compared glucose self-monitoring real-time result transmission and feedback of results for the previous 24 h in the control group with real-time graphical phone-based feedback for the previous 2 weeks together with nurse-initiated support using a web-based graphical analysis of glucose self-monitoring results in the intervention group. All patients aged 18-30 years with HbA1c (A1C) levels of 8-11\% were eligible for inclusion.  RESULTS--A total of 93 patients (55 men) with mean diabetes duration (means \{+/-\} SD) 12.1 \{+/-\} 6.7 years were recruited from a young adult clinic. In total, the intervention and control groups transmitted 29,765 and 21,400 results, respectively. The corresponding median blood glucose levels were 8.9 mmol/l (interquartile range 5.4-13.5) and 10.3 mmol/l (6.5-14.4) (P < 0.0001). There was a reduction in A1C in the intervention group after 9 months from 9.2 \{+/-\} 1.1 to 8.6 \{+/-\} 1.4\% (difference 0.6\% [95\% CI 0.3-1.0]) and a reduction in A1C in the control group from 9.3 \{+/-\} 1.5 to 8.9 \{+/-\} 1.4\% (difference 0.4\% [0.03-0.7]). This difference in change in A1C between groups was not statistically significant (0.2\% [-0.2 to 0.7, P = 0.3).  CONCLUSIONS--Real-time telemedicine transmission and feedback of information about blood glucose results with nurse support is feasible and acceptable to patients, but to significantly improve glycemic control, access to real-time decision support for medication dosing and changes in diet and exercise may be required.},

@article{Marcin2003,
abstract = {Objective. For children with special health care needs (CSHCN) that live in rural, medically underserved communities, obtaining subspecialty care is a challenge. Telemedicine is a means of improving access to these children by addressing rural physician shortages and geographic barriers. This article reports a medical-needs assessment of parents/guardians with CSHCN and the status of a telemedicine program for CSHCN as well as the results of parent/guardian and local provider satisfaction with the telemedicine program.  Design. We report the results of a pretelemedicine medical-needs survey conducted in March 1999 by using a convenience sample of CSHCN living in a rural, medically underserved community located 90 miles north of the University of California Davis Children's Hospital (Davis, CA). In April 1999, a telemedicine program was initiated to provide consultations to CSHCN and has continued since. We also report the parent/guardian's perceptions of the appropriateness and quality of telemedicine consultations and the local provider's satisfaction with telemedicine consultations completed from April 1999 to April 2002.  Results. The pretelemedicine medical-needs assessment demonstrated several barriers in access to subspecialty care including traveling >1 hour for appointments (86\% of parents/guardians), missing work for appointments (96\% of working parents/guardians), and frequently relying on emergency department services and/or self-regulation of their child's medications. From April 1999 to April 2002, 130 telemedicine consultations were completed on 55 CSHCN. Overall, satisfaction was very high. All the parents/guardians rated satisfaction with telemedicine care as either "excellent" or "very good," and all but 2 of the rural providers' surveys reported satisfaction with telemedicine as "excellent" or "very good." The frequency of telemedicine consultations has increased with time.  Conclusions. Pediatric subspecialty telemedicine consultations can be provided to CSHCN living in a rural, medically underserved community with high satisfaction among local providers and parents/guardians. Telemedicine should be considered as a means of facilitating care to CSHCN that, relative to the customary delivery of health care, is more accessible, family-centered, and coordinated among patients and their health care providers.},
