abstract = {An information-theoretic model for steganography with a passive adversary is proposed. The adversary’s task of distinguishing between an innocent cover message C and a modified message S containing hidden information is interpreted as a hypothesis testing problem. The security of a steganographic system is quantified in terms of the relative entropy (or discrimination) between the distributions of C and S, which yields bounds on the detection capability of any adversary. It is shown that secure steganographic schemes exist in this model provided the covertext distribution satisfies certain conditions. A universal stegosystem is presented in this model that needs no knowledge of the covertext distribution, except that it is generated from independently repeated experiments.},
annote = {Considers the "distance" between the covertext prob disto P\_C and the stegotext prob distro P\_S as the "relative entropy" (aka Kullback-Leiber distance) between them---and defines perfect secrecy as the distance = 0

        
from wikipedia: "Specifically, the Kullback-Leibler divergence of Q from P is a measure of the information lost when Q is used to approximate P"

abstract = {In this paper, we present a framework for the design of steganographic schemes that can provide provable security by achieving zero Kullback-Leibler divergence between the cover and the stego signal distributions, while hiding at high rates. The approach is to reserve a number of host symbols for statistical restoration: host statistics perturbed by data embedding are restored by suitably modifying the symbols from the reserved set. A dynamic embedding approach is proposed, which avoids hiding in low probability regions of the host distribution. The framework is applied to design practical schemes for image steganography, which are evaluated using supervised learning on a set of about 1000 natural images. For the presented JPEG steganography scheme, it is seen that the detector is indeed reduced to random guessing},
annote = {Statistical restoration:
We want to create a stegosignal with statistics that are close to the coversignal. But we are allowed some distortion. IDEA: spend part of the distortion "budget" to restore the statistics to the covertext statistics.},
