abstract = {The phase-field method has recently emerged as a powerful computa- tional approach to modeling and predicting mesoscale morphological and microstruc- ture evolution in materials. It describes a microstructure using a set of conserved and nonconserved field variables that are continuous across the interfacial regions. The temporal and spatial evolution of the field variables is governed by the Cahn-Hilliard nonlinear diffusion equation and the Allen-Cahn relaxation equation.With the funda- mental thermodynamic and kinetic information as the input, the phase-field method is able to predict the evolution of arbitrary morphologies and complex microstructures without explicitly tracking the positions of interfaces. This paper briefly reviews the recent advances in developing phase-field models for various materials processes in- cluding solidification, solid-state structural phase transformations, grain growth and coarsening, domain evolution in thin films, pattern formation on surfaces, dislocation microstructures, crack propagation, and electromigration.},

abstract = {The recent development of the phase-field models for solidification and their application examples are briefly reviewed. The phase-field model is firstly proposed for pure material systems and then extended to binary alloy, multi-phase and multi-component systems theoretically. Though the calculation conditions are limited due to the sharp interface limit parameters in the early stage, it is widened in the thin interface limit model. The development of the phase-field model is summarized from a viewpoint of the formulation of phase-field equation and parameters. The important studies and the latest results such as application exam- ples of free dendrite growth, directional solidification, Ostwald ripening, interface-particle interaction and multi-phase simulation are mentioned. Finally future works of the phase-field model are prospected.},
