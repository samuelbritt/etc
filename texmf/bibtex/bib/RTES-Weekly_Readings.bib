thorough specialization: reduce code to specific case of app for performance improvements
conservative specialization: preserve the usage scope of the system

hinges on knowlege of program invarients which can allow for eliminating conditionals, use of instruction immediates rather than memory lookups, and resulting code has better cache properties},

annote = {FC control on scheduling
measuring "progress" of jobs (note: better than missed deadlines, probably harder to measure)
controlling "proportion" and "period of CPU (offers fine grained control)

        
measuring progress
 - requires app-level support (prod/cons buffer size, app role)?
 - can use heuristics (determine whether app blocks, or uses what it requires). Same thing priority uses.

        
implemented with linux's goodness property

        
uses PID control

        
i'm worried that there are too many scheduling "special cases"--- real time, real rate, aperiodic, interactive, etc. is this easily determinable or do apps have to tell you? do threads always fall into one of these categories?

        
"believe" they can reduce the oscillation---will PID parameter adjustments help? what are those numbers?},

"rare" bottlenecks becoming more common

        
single-bottleneck: satruated resource exhibits linearly load-dependent utilization up to 100\%

        
multi-bottleneck: classified according to resource dependencies and frequency of resource saturation---difficult or impossible to analyze, need data-based approach

        
CloudXPlor modules:
response time analysis  (correlated with SLA), throughput analysis (correlated with costs),
cost/revenue analysys, profit analysis

        
Do the experimental results require the infrastructure to already be in place to get the data? What good is it  for the tool to tell me it is more profitable to have a smaller infrastructure?},

annote = {automatically infers b/w reqs. through fill level of per-flow queue

        
Flow types:
real rate: need a minimum rate, but if more is given they won't use it (e.g., video playback)
greedy: will take as little or as much as you give it (file transfer)

        
Network controls:
congestion ctrl: bw doesn't exceed end-to-end bottleneck
flow ctrl: sending rate doesn't exceed receiving rate

        
BW allocation: limited by the minimum of 
 - flow's application-level requirement
 - tcp congenstion control limit
 - tcp flow control limit
 - available interface bw

        
Proportion-perioid:
RAMP guarantees x\% of total bw for interval y
(all flows get same period)

        
requires app-level support to determine greedy/real rate
 - all greedy treated as a single real-rate w/ default minimum

        
monitoring implemented using system calls from user level!!!

annote = {EDF: "Earliest deadline first"

        
control variable: dealine miss ratio
manipulated var: CPU util (load) *requested* by all *accepted* tasks
 - other possiblity: periods/deadlines of tasks
actuators: service level controller called first) and admission controller (called if SL Controller can't do the job)

        
tasks = (I, ET, Val, S, D)
I = (Ti1, Ti2, ..., Tik) k versions (service levels) of the same task
For each version Tij, normal (not worst) exe time is ETij and value is Valij: longer ET and higher Val means higher service level
Si, Di: start time and (soft) deadline.

        
Workload:
WCET, BCET (worst case, best case exe time)
AET, EET (actual average, expected exe time)
EET = 1/2 (WCET + BCET)
AET = EET * eft
eft > 1 => actual is greater than expected

        
Weakness: give some (unproven) theory about the ranges on coeffeicients, but don't really state their effect on the response (no parametric study). No looking at derivative/integral control separately. No tuning of requirements---stated goal of 1\% MRA, but can jum as high as 10\%. Is that OK?

        
Strength: very good at walking through figure 9, though I'd like to see either eft plotted on the same graph, or the graph annotated with the new values of etf at the relevant points.

        
Evaluation metrics:
MRA: miss ratio among admitted tasks (no. misses/no. admitted tasks) 
CPU Util.
HRS: hit ratio among sumbitted tasks (no. tasks completed within deadline/no. admitted tasks)
VCR: value completeion ratio (sum of vals of hits/sum of vals of submitted tasks)
